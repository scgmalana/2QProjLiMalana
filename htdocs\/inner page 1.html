                Fear is humanity's greatest enemy. We do horrible things because of fear. It drives us, pushes us to act, and clouds our judgement.
                To quote Yoda, “Fear is the path to the dark side … fear leads to anger … anger leads to hate … hate leads to suffering.”. 
                And it is fear that pushes the world of Bloodborne. The hunters fear the beasts, and the beasts fear the hunters. 
                And as a player, you fear them too. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Bloodborne uses a lot of different fears to make you act. And the horrors the game uses evolves from a more traditional, victorian style horror with werewolves and crows into a 
                Lovecraftian horror, with entities that humanity can't comprehend. And the game manages this perfectly. The game makes you fear your surroundings the entire time. Every nook and cranny covered in darkness could be one that has an enemy, and that enemy could be the one that kills you.
                The first enemy is a werewolf, a monster people typically fear. A later boss in the game is a spider.

                You're driven to find out more about the world because of the unknown. But what's incredible about Bloodborne is how consistently it keeps you afraid. 
                The victorian streets of Yharnam are narrow, and it's made worse that they're filled with coffins and bodies. A plague scares people into hiding in their homes as beasts roam the streets.
                And it is through overcoming these fears that the player is able to overcome the obstacles in the game. 
                <br>
                <br> 
                The gameplay of Bloodborne is much faster than that of Fromsoftware's previous entries. 
                It achieves this through literally making things faster. Your roll is now a sidestep, your weapon swings faster, your parry is quicker. But the speed of the combat is compensated by additional risks.
                The shields that once protected players from the enemies of previous games is gone. No longer can you block and hide from the demons and beasts; now you must face them head on.
                In its stead, the game gives you a firearm of your choice. The gun, equipped on your left hand, is now used to stagger and parry enemies. They switched out the much more passive shield in favor of a more active gun, and it works to great effect.
                It relies on silver bullets though, which you have a limit to how many you can carry. This makes each shot of the gun crucial, as if you miss the parry or the shot entirely, there goes that bullet. 
                As a player, you're encouraged to take risks and parry enemies rather than sit behind a shield while they attack. You're encouraged to sidestep attacks and counter while they're still attacking because the enemies
                animations are faster as well. Bosses like the Bloodstarved Beast and Father Gascoigne showcase this in brutal fashion. They're fast and rarely give the player a chance to breath, which makes sense since that's what a beast would do if this were real life.

                It's up to the player to bob and weave around their attacks while striking back with their own. The game encourages this with the new 'Rally' system, where you can heal back some of the damage you just took if you strike back.
                This often makes it more worthwhile to get even more aggressive than to step back and heal. Yet by being more aggressive, you open yourself up to more mistakes.
                Another change they made to the combat was the change to the way you heal. Outside of rallying, the famous estus flask in previous entries has been replaced with vials of blood.
                Like the rest of the combat, they're much faster than drinking estus but they too come with a drawback. Only 20 of them can be held at a time, and they're non-replenishable. Use one and it's gone forever.
                Only by killing more enemies can you find more blood vials. 
                Overall, these changes push the player towards a more aggressive playstyle. You're encouraged to take out an enemy before it can hit you, and encouraged to strike back if it does.
                You're encouraged to overcome your fears and strike back at them. ]

                If you want to learn more about Bloodborne, I suggest checking out this video from hbomberguy. It's pretty long, but I really enjoy it and think it's very well made.
