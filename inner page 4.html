                Metroid Dread is the long awaited entry to the 2D Metroid franchise. Fans waited 19 years for another 2D Metroid game, and they surely got what they want. Every aspect of Dread is incredibly designed.
                From its bosses, to its gameplay, and especially to its levels. This is the game I thought should have won Game of the Year last year and I'll explain why'\
                <br>
                <br>
                First of all, exploration in this game is such a treat. I love the Metroidvania style of game, where you have a large map and as you travel across it you find upgrades that allow you to reach old sections of the map that were previously unreachable.
                Dread does this perfectly, having you backtrack and explore previous areas to get new upgrades while never feeling tedious. It manages that sense of progression wonderfully, and I never wanted it to stop.
                Even as I reached the final area and got the final upgrade, I thouhght to myself "Well, surely there's more". It never feels like it's dragging its feet or repeating something done before. Every upgrade opens the game up in new ways and allows for such freedom.

                <br>
                Exploration is one thing, but without combat, it would be pretty meaningless. And Metroid Dread handles combat spectacularly. Samus's movement is fluid, and shooting feels great. You must position yourself in the right spots while making sure to use the correct weapon for the job all while dodging the relentless attacks of your foes.
                Aiding you in this is the melee counter. Upon pressing the corresponding button, you do a counter move that knocks back enemies when they attack. It keeps combat fast, never making you feel like you're on the defensive. You can do it while running too.
                To add to the combat are the games incredible bossfights. One such fight is the fight against Kraid, a large godzilla like monster that Samus has fought before. The fight is enjoyable as you dodge his spikes and acid while shooting him with missiles and bombs.

                I won't talk too much about the story, as I think it's best explored on its own, but the premise is that Samus has been sent to Planet ZDR to exterminate the X-Parasite mysteriously found on the planet and recover the old robots, the EMMIS, that were sent there before her.
                The robots have gone haywire, and chase you throughout the game in their designated EMMI zones. They're immune to all attacks, so being in such zone is another source of dread, as you have to sneak around and carefully avoid them to get out alive.

                Here's another review of Metroid Dread by a creator I really like. His name is Maximillian Dood, go check him out.
