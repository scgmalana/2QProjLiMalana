                        Hello! I'm Cary Malana, a student at Philippine Science High School, and I really like video games. 
                        So, I decided that this website would be about video games. More specifically, the games I've played and would like to talk about. It'll sort of be like a blog.
                        There'll be reviews on each game listed and you can read them to learn about my opinion. Oh and there'll be spoilers in the reviews so be warned. I hope you enjoy.

                                    Bloodborne is my favorite game of all time. 
                                    Fromsoftware's masterful ability to control the atmosphere enhances the setting of Yharnam to such great lengths.
                                    And, coupled along with one of the best gameplay systems Fromsoft has made, you get the game I'd consider to be their best work.

                                    Yakuza is over the top and dramatic, and Yakuza 0 is no exception. From its thrilling story to the game's combat to its wild sidequests, every part of Yakuza 0 keeps you glued to the screen. 
                                    It features some of my favorite writing in any video game, with both the jokes and the emotional moments landing. In fact, that's what makes Yakuza so good. It's able to handle and mix these wildly different tones to create an experience greater than the sum of its parts.

                                    Kingdom Hearts as a whole gets a bad rep for how convoluted the story can get at times. Which is fair, but that shouldn't make people look away from such a fun franchise.
                                    Kingdom Hearts 2 has some of the best combat I've played in any game, and the story, while a bit confusing, was enjoyable to experience. It also has an incredible soundtrack.

                                    Easily the best game of the last year, Metroid Dread gives you a sense of isolation and, fittingly, dread, as you navigate the areas of Planet ZDR.
