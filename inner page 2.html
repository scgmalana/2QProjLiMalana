                From beating up thugs on the streets, to becoming a real estate tycoon, to engaging in dance battles at the dance club, to uncovering a mystery surrounding the Yakzua, Yakuza 0 takes you on a trip so ridiculous and over the top yet so well-executed
                that you can't comprehend how it pulled it off. The Yakuza series as a whole is very tonally contradicting, switching between goofy hijinx on the streets of Kamurocho to serious drama while you uncover the secrets of the yakuza.

                While most other open-world games concern themselves with large, sprawling open worlds, Yakuza 0 takes the opposite approach. It chooses to relegate itself to two comparatively small districts, but pack them to the brim with minigames and sidecontent.
                The streets of Kamurocho and Sotenbori are filled to the brim with substories that let you get to know the residents of these districts and their problems, ranging from dealing with the problems of an errand boy to dealing with a strange cult, yet all of them are filled to the brim with funny writing that genuinely had me laughing out loud.
                The other form of sidecontent are the various minigames scattered around the town. There're arcade machines, darts, karaoke, and even more obscure games like mahjong, which I learnt how to play because of Yakuza. Besides those smaller ones, there are two big 
                minigame sidecontent in the form of the Real Estate Royale and the Cabaret Club Czar minigames. They're surprisingly deep, and could be whole games on their own.

                Yakuza 0, released as the 6th entry of the series coming after Yakuza 5 and before 6, takes a look back on the origins of its two most iconic characters, Kiryu Kazuma, the Dragon of Dojima, and Goro Majima, the Mad Dog of Shimano. 
                These two Yakuza legends take center stage in the story, switching between their perspectives every 2 chapters to check in on what the others up to. In Yakuza 1 and onwards, they're treated as untouchable legends of the underworld, seen as forces to be reckoned with and as mountains to be climbed.
                But Yakuza 0 shows us them before the legends began, and it shows them at their most humble. Kiryu confronts his idealization of the Yakuza, and wakes up to what the job actually entails compared to what he wants it to be. He views it as a way to make a stand in society, without having to deal with the monotony and inaction of politics.
                He sees it as his way to make a mark in the world, to help those in need, to be righteous. But that is far from the reality of the job. He has to work for evil people, selfish people, people who connive and backstab at every turn to get what they want. 
                On the other side, Majima also struggles with the structure of the underworld, being forced to put on facades and work for people he doesn't respect. In his story, he has to do things he doesn't want to, by someone who treats him horribly, all to get what he wants in the end. Majima, in the series's other installments, is a wild card.
                He does what he want when he wants and you never know what he's really thinking. He switches between facade to facade, never showing his true colors, yet still does the right thing at the end of the day. In this game, he takes on a much much different persona, being a rule-obeying criminal and doesn't challenge authority.
                As he meets the other influential members of the story, he learns to take a stand for himself and becomes the "Mad Dog" that he's known as later on.
