                Kingdom Hearts is known for its confusing story, filled with clones and time travel and hearts and light and darkness and everything inbetween. As such, it gets a bad rep as being just another jrpg but this time with
                a bad story. But I don't think that's all that deserved. Kingdom Hearts has confusing lore, sure, but the story is simple at its core. Combat may look convoluted, but it's no more than a few button presses. And at the end of the day,
                you have to look at the heart of the series to really appreciate it. And in my opinion, the best Kingdom Hearts is this one, the second one. Let's take a dive to the heart of this game to see why I enjoy it so much.
                <br>
                <br>
                What I love the most about this game, and what I think it does better than many other games, is its gameplay. Kingdom Hearts is an action rpg, focusing on real time combat.
                The first Kingdom Hearts game takes a very grounded and slower approach to combat, attacks being made up of two to three hits. There are special actions, such as magic, that can be taken in exchange for MP, which adds more variety to the combat. 
                But what makes Kingdom Hearts 2's combat better than its predecessor is how it expands on the systems. KH2's combat is flashier, taking you from the ground to the air and back, weaving in magic and special attacks in between your hits.
                I played the game on Critical Mode, a special difficulty available at the start of the game that makes Sora, the player character, die quicker in exchange for making him do more damage. And this made the game so much fun! Combat became a medley of dodges and attacks, 
                using the high speed and moves available to your disposal to take out enemies while avoiding their moves, because getting hit once can prove fatal. Supporting you are two of your favorite childhood characters, Donald and Goofy. They provide support through casting spells and attacking enemies, though most of the fighting is done by Sora.
                Another thing KH2 adds are reaction commands, special actions that can be taken in battle to beat your opponent when the opportunity arises. They can do all sorts of things, from blocking a dangerous attack, to getting on the other side of the enemy. They make it so you're glued to the screen, waiting for the next command to potentially take control of the fight.

                The story is simple. ish. It takes place after the previous two games, Chain of Memories, and Kingdom Hearts. It starts of with Roxas, a clone of Sora who must leave his life behind to return to our protagonist so that he may
                wake up and save the world yet again. And that's what I'd say is the core of this game. Identity is very important to this games story. The antagonists are nobodies, clones of deceased people, who formed Organization XIII in an attempt to harness the power
                of Kingdom Hearts and become somebody again. The game tackles the idea of what you are. Are you just a clone, or can you be something more? What defines a person? That's what I believe the game to be saying past the typical good vs evil trope.

                <br>
                The game's levels take place in the worlds of classic Disney movies such as "Beauty and the Beast" or the "Lion King". You traverse these worlds, helping their inhabitants fulfill the story of their movie. These worlds, in accordance with the theme, usually tackle the idea of identity.
                The Beast is a man on the inside but a monster on the outside, Mulan is pretending to be a man, Simba must face the music and become a king, Aladdin isn't really a prince, etc. The levels are vibrant and capture the look and feel of their respective movie. There are also worlds that are 
                original to the Kingdom Hearts series, and they look just as great as the rest.
